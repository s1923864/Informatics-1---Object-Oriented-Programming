# Informatics-1---Object-Oriented-Programming


This course presents a conceptual and practical introduction to imperative and object oriented programming, exemplified by Java. As well as providing a grounding in the use of Java, the course will cover general principles of programming in an imperative object oriented paradigm. The course should enable you to develop programs that support experimentation, simulation and exploration in other parts of the Informatics curriculum (e.g. the capacity to implement, test and observe a particular algorithm).


Students on this course have a very wide range of backgrounds: some are already expert programmers, others near-beginners. Moreover students going on to an Informatics degree will all need far more Java expertise than this course can provide, and more expertise will make your lives easier! Therefore this course is designed to be very flexible, giving you the opportunity and responsibility to make optimal use of your time. The main way to learn programming is by doing it.
